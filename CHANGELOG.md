# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed

- `Alter` now merely requires an `Fn1` instead of an explicit `Effect`

### Added

- `Prism#andThen`, `Prism#compose` begets another `Prism`
- `Prism#fromPartial` public interfaces
- `ReaderT`, the transformer for the reader monad 

## [4.0.0] - 2019-05-20
### Changed
- ***Breaking Change***: `IO` is now sealed and moved to its own package. Most previous constructions using the static 
                         factory methods should continue to work (by simply targeting `Supplier` now instead of an 
                         anonymous `IO`), but some might need to be reworked, and subtyping is obviously no longer 
                         supported.
- ***Breaking Change***: Breaking all dependency on `java.util.function` types across the board. All `Fn*` types target 
                         methods now support throwing `Throwable`; `apply` is now defaulted and will simply bypass javac 
                         to throw checked exceptions as if they were unchecked. All `Checked` variants have been 
                         eliminated as a consequence, as they are no longer necessary. Also, straggler functions like 
                         `Partial2/3` that only existed to aid in partial application of non-curried functions are now
                         superfluous, and have also been eliminated.
- ***Breaking Change***: `FoldRight` now requires `Lazy` as part of its interface to support short-circuiting operations
- ***Breaking Change***: Eliminated all raw types and java11 warnings. This required using capture in unification 
                         parameters for Functor and friends, so nearly every functor's type-signature changed. 
- ***Breaking Change***: `Strong` is now called `Cartesian` to better reflect the type of strength
- ***Breaking Change***: new Optic type hierarchy more faithfully encodes profunctor constraints on optics, new `Optic`
                         type is now the supertype of `Lens` and `Iso`, and `lens` package has been moved to `optics`
- ***Breaking Change***: `Try` and `Either` no longer preserve `Throwable` type since it was inherently not type-safe 
                         anyway; Try is therefore no longer a `Bifunctor`, and `orThrow` can be used to declare checked
                         exceptions that could be caught by corresponding catch blocks  
- `IO` is now stack-safe, regardless of whether the composition nests linearly or recursively
